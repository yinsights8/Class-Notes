- 1. Problem Statement
- 2. Data Gatherning (CSV,Excel,Images,Videos,PDF,Text,JSON etc)
- 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) (Pandas,Numpy,Matplotlib,Seaborn) >> We mostly spend 70% time in EDA
- 4. Feature Engineering (Scaling,We need to handle Outliers)
- 5. Feature Selection (We can keep the Required Features to train the model, Correlation)
- 6. Model Building / Training (Linear Regression,Logistic Regression,DT,RF,AdaBoost,KNN,SVM,Naive Bayes)
- 7. Model Evaluation (MSE, MAE, R2Score, classification Report,Confusion Matrix, Accuracy)
- 8. Project Deployment (AWS, Microsoft Azure, GCP, Herokku)
        - a. Cloud / Instance Creation - Using EC@ Service
        - b. Python and dependencies  - Required files and libraries
        - c. App configuration - Running app/main/interface files
